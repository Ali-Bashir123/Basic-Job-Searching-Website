HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were used to create this simple job search website. The project's goal is to showcase the essential features of a straightforward and easy-to-use platform for job searchers. There are three primary pages in it:

Homepage: This landing page's simple, responsive design informs visitors of the website's goal and makes it simple to navigate to other areas.
Users can estimate their prospective earnings depending on their working hours and hourly salary using the Pay Calculator Page. Job searchers can better grasp compensation expectations for various roles with the help of this feature.
A list of open positions is displayed on the vacancy search page. In addition to viewing basic job descriptions and browsing the postings, users can filter or search by job title or location (which may be static or dynamic depending on how you implement it).
The website is completely responsive, meaning it will function flawlessly on a variety of screens and devices. Dynamic components including form validation, pay calculator computations, and interactive job listing features are handled by JavaScript.
More sophisticated features like user login, job application submission, database integration, or API-based job listing updates are built upon this project.
